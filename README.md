My Dotfiles
===========

**Stratus3D**

My dotfiles. Everything I need to get setup on a new machine.

### Installation
Run the `setup.sh`. This will install all the necessary software, setup commonly used directories, and install dotfiles.

    curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stratus3D/dotfiles/master/scripts/setup.sh
    sh setup.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/setup.log

### Issues
* Since these dotfiles are shared across my machines, there are scenarios where PATH will need to be different. PATH will need to be customized in `path`.

### TODO
* Complete the setup script so it installs all software and configures iterm2 with my custom profile.
* Complete the `clone_all_bitbucket_repos.sh` script so that all private repos can be cloned.
* Complete the `erlang_manager.sh` and `hosts_manager.sh` scripts.
* Allow for custom config files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.gitconfig`) and custom scripts.
* Figure out how to setup devdocs.io/zealdocs locally when running the setup script.
* Make all `source`s relative.
* Toggle syntastic icons at the beginning of the lines with F4.

###Useful commands that I often forget
Bash/Zshell Commands

* `open .` to open current directory in Finder
* `open -a TextEdit textfile.txt` to open a file in a specific application
* `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` runs a webserver that serves the contents of the directory
* `python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25` runs a SMTP server that logs all messages to the console
* `^X, ^E` to edit the currently typed command in vim
* `!!` run the last command again
* `cd -` change back to the previous directory
* `^A` move to the start of the line
* `^E` move to the end of the line
* `^B` move back one character
* `Esc-B` move back one word
* `Esc-F` move forward one word
* `^U` delete from cursor to the beginning of the line
* `^K` delete from the cursor to the end of the line
* `^Y` paste previously deleted command (separate from global Cmd-C buffer). Delete a line with `^A ^K` and then paste it back with `^Y`
* Files/directories can be dragged onto the terminal and the path will be pasted at the current cursor position
* `command <<< "input text"` can be used in place of `command < file.in`
* `pkill <process_name>` kills all processes with the given name (e.g. `pkill HipChat` kills the HipChat app)
* `kill <process_id>` kills the process identified by `<process_id>`. `-9` can be used to kill the process immediately
* `echo -n âœ˜ | hexdump` to print the encoding of a character by the console. Useful for bash scripts
* `ssh -vT git@github.com` useful for debugging SSH authentication issues.

Vim Commands

* `vit` select contents of html tag. `v`isual select text `i`n a `t`ag. `dit` would delete the contents of the tag.
* `^A` and `^X` allow you to increment the number your cursor is over, or first number after the cursor that is on the same line.
* `<F4>` toggles everything that occupies space to the left of the text (line numbers, gitgutter, etc...)
* `^F-[` in tmux works the same as `^F <PageUp>`, which puts tmux into scroll mode. This command comes in handy on keyboards that don't have `<PageUp>` and `<PageDown>`.
* `:21,25s/old/new/g` to substitute `new` for `old on lines 21 through 25.
* When scrolling in tmux, `<fn> <UpArrow>` and `<fn> <DownArrow>` can be used instead of `<PageUp>` and `<PageDown>`. This also comes in handy on keyboards that lack Page Up and Page Down.

SSH/SCP Commands

* `scp localfile user@remotehost:~` to copy `localfile` up to your home directory on `remotehost`.

Make Targets and Commands

* `print-%: ; @echo $*=$($*)` or `print-%: ; @echo '$(subst ','\'',$*=$($*))'` allows you to run `make print-<variable_name>` and print the value of any variable. Can be used without modifying the file in GNU make 3.82 or greater like this: `make --eval="print-%: ; @echo $*=$($*)" print-SOURCE_FILES`.

Screen Commands

* `^A d` detach current window.
* `screen -rd` to reattach a window. Follow the prompts if there are multiple windows.

Irssi Commands

* `/server`
* `/connect <server name>` - Connect to an IRC server (`/connect irc.freenode.net`)
* `/join <channel name>` - Join a channel on an IRC server (`/join #erlang`)
* `/disconnect`
* `/q <users nick>`  starts a private message with a user.
* `/wc` closes the current window. This parts from the current channel or disconnects from the current network.
* `Alt + Left Arrow/Right Arrow` scroll through Irssi windows.

### Software
This is software that I need for my day-to-day programming work. I try to keep this list updated with the latest software I am using. This allows me to quickly setup new development machines. I am developing a script named checkenv.sh that will verify everything is setup properly.
