My Dotfiles
===========

Stratus3D

My dotfiles. 

### Installation

    # download the files
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/Stratus3D/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles/

    # run the install script, which symlinks the dotfiles
    chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
    ./makesymlinks.sh

### Issues

* Since these dotfiles are shared across my machines, there are scenarios where portions of the dotfiles will need to be altered. Such as the as the path variables in zshrc.

### Software
This is software that I need for my day-to-day programming work. I try to keep this list updated with the latest software I am using. This allows me to quickly setup new development machines.
